# Lambda Kernculus

This repository contains a Jupyter kernel implementing the lambda calculus. This is used to support the lambda calculus in Enscribe.

The machinery connecting to the outside world is written in Python, and the [lambda calculus implementation](lambda.md) itself is written in [Hy](https://hylang.org/), a lisp dialect which compiles to Python AST.
